# 🚀 Portfolio Website (Static Clone)

This repository contains a **static HTML/CSS adaptation** of a fully functional WordPress website. 

The project was originally designed and developed in a local **WordPress** environment (XAMPP) using **Elementor** and the **Phlox** theme, then converted into a static site to demonstrate frontend design capabilities, performance optimization, and secure static hosting.

## ⚠️ Limitations (Static Demo)

As this is a static showcase of a dynamic CMS site, the following backend features are **disabled**:

1.  **Contact Forms:** The PHP backend has been removed, so forms do not submit emails (visuals only).
2.  **Site Search:** Database queries are not possible in this static version.
3.  **Comments/Login:** User authentication features are inactive.

*Note: You may notice minor visual discrepancies (such as card heights) compared to the live WP version due to the CSS extraction process.*
